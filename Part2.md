# Chosen Idea: Fantasy Curling League

We are making a database that can be used to supplement a fantasy curling league. Currently, there are websites that claim to host a fantasy league, but they are very limited in statistics (only stating win/loss) and capabilities (poor trading functions). Our database will be much more in depth, comparing statistics such as domestic vs. international win percentage and standard deviation of scores, allowing league participants to be better informed and more engaged. As we accumulate more data, we can start to see which players are in high demand and also provide that information to the users. Additionally, since curling is a team sport, we can use our data to allow certain players to “boost” other players based on a calculated “chemistry” if they are drafted onto the same team. Players will compete based on players at that particular time, and a computer will decide the outcome based on the statistics of each player (If a player’s average score is high and their standard deviation is low, they are likely to score high; however, if a player’s average score is high but their standard deviation is high, their score may be high but may be low). The team's overall performance will be updated weekly based on real-life curling matches. 

It will include five tables:
-Competitor name (example: “Kevin Martin”)
-Average score per round in international matches (constrained to be between 0-8, which are the minimum and maximum -possible scores in a single round) 
-Average score per round in domestic matches (again constrained to be between 0-8) 
-Overall standard deviation of scores
-Overall team performance (real-time/dynamic)

Goal: Our goal is to provide easy-to-understand data that allows participants in fantasy curling leagues to make more informed decisions. For example, if two fantasy participants are about to “play” in a domestic match, we With this in-depth data, participants can better predict competitor performance and more effectively develop teams and trade deals. With real time roster updates, it will be easy to determine weekly player additions and drops. 
Daily use of this product will be similar to that of a fantasy football database. Fantasy football databases are one of the most thorough examples of sports analytics. The curling database will be organized by competitor entities (each containing individual attributes that detail their skill level and point potential) and will allow users to compose teams and simulate a game based on a player’s statistics at a given time. The different tables that we will take into consideration will help with not both pre-season and mid- Something unique about this league is that the location of the game is a factor. Curling is an internationally recognized sport, and, similar to other sports, we must consider if there is a home field advantage. Thus, we will provide a game schedule before the season begins, proposing when and where fantasy competitors will compete against each other. For example, if Player X’s team is composed entirely of USA players who have high domestic scoring potential and is scheduled to compete in the USA, they will have a much higher likelihood of winning the match.
